  "readme": "Calipso\n-------\n\nCalipso is a simple NodeJS content management system, built along\nsimilar themes to Drupal and Wordpress, that is designed to be fast,\nflexible and simple.\n\nFor additional details, including installation instructions, please\nvisit the home page: [http://calip.so/][]\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please take a look at the issues list\nas this will have the most up to date view of work that needs to be done\nfor the next minor release. Otherwise, please just pm myself (cliftonc),\ndennis (dennishall) or dale (dtan) and we can suggest some places for\nyou to start.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cliftonc/calipso.png)](https://travis-ci.org/cliftonc/calipso)\n\n### Quick Install\n\nIf you want to try it out as quickly as possible, please install\nMongoDB, ensure that you have the right compilers installed (for OSX,\nXCode4 will work, for Ubuntu, the build-essential and libssl-dev\npackages) and then use NPM:\n\n```sh\n        npm install calipso -g\n        calipso site /var/www/MySite\n        cd /var/www/MySite\n        calipso server\n```\nNote the server will output an installation password during install to prevent\nsome other person from installing your server.\nThe output will look something like this:\n```\nInstallation Password: \"5ng/joSjSXS9RsERDXVGk40Ih2PP5YC/7w==\" (inside quotes)\n```\n\n#### NOTE: Mongoose upgraded to 3.6.x\n\nThis causes the sort api to change. In order to run under SmartOS mongoose had to be upgraded\nto in turn upgrade mongodb to 1.3.x.\nWhen sorting rather than\n```javascript\nquery.sort('column', 1).sort('column2', -1)\n```\n\nUse\n\n```javascript\nquery.sort('column -column2')\n```\n\nInstead.\n\n#### Using environment variables\n\nThe site will respond to a environment variable called MONGO_URI. If MONGO_URI is set\nthen the configuration storage will move from the /conf folder into the mongodb database\npointed to by the MONGO_URI. This allows easy deployment of a calipso site to a nodejs\nhosting provider. To re-install or install, calipso will ask for an installation password\nwhich is a randomly generated string which will be logged to your log file.\nCopy this string and paste it into the UI to proceed. The system will overwrite and adjust\nthe username/password your specify for the admin which previously was a little bit of a problem.\nTo \"re-install\" use your mongo command shell to update the settings in the database as follows:\n\n```javascript\ndb.confs.update({environment:'development'},{$set:{\"configuration.installed\":false}})\n```\nor\n```javascript\ndb.confs.update({environment:'production'},{$set:{\"configuration.installed\":false}})\n```\n\n#### Using node v0.5.3 and later\n\nSince node v0.5.3 has removed <code>require.paths</code>, in order to\n<code>require(‘lib/calipso’)</code>, you must include the following to\nyour file:\n\n```javascript\nvar rootpath = process.cwd() + '/',\n  path = require('path'),\n  calipso = require(path.join(rootpath, 'lib/calipso'));\n```\n    That also goes for including anything that is based on the root path of the project directory.\n\n### Development Steps\n\n    To get running in development mode (not the site mode outlined on the front page) - e.g. so you can make changes to core and submit pull requests:\n\n    1.  Fork the repository\n    2.  Clone from your fork (replace YOURNAME!): git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/calipso.git\n    3.  Run 'npm install -d' in the clone folder to install all of the dependencies.\n    4.  Run 'node app' to run Calipso from the source folder.\n\n    Note that the bin/calipso command line script is really designed to allow people who just want to use Calipso to build sites to use it, it isn't used in the dev process.  As always, any questions please do shout.\n\n### Calipso Command Line Client\n\n    The commands currently supported from the command line client are:\n\n#### Commands That Run Anywhere\n\n```sh\n        calipso                            : Show this help file.\n        calipso site <name|folder>         : Create site in folder.\n```\n\n#### Commands That Run In Site Folder\n\nThe most important of these at the moment is ‘modules check’ (this will\nensure that all modules have all of their dependencies installed via\nnpm), and should be run on site install.\n\n```sh\n        calipso install                    : Re-run site install.\n\n        calipso cluster --port=3000        : Run as cluster.\n        calipso server --port=3000         : Run as a single server.\n\n        calipso modules list               : List installed modules.\n        calipso modules check              : Check installation of all modules.\n        calipso modules install *mod@ver   : Install module@version, or reinstall module.\n        calipso modules download github    : Download module from github (e.g. cliftonc/calipso-elastic)\n        calipso modules enable *mod        : Enable module.\n        calipso modules disable *mod       : Disable module.\n\n        calipso themes list                : List installed themes.\n        calipso themes uninstall *theme    : Remove theme (delete from disk)\n        calipso themes download *url       : Download (url: http://, gh: cliftonc/calipso-site-theme, repo: calipso-site).\n```\n\n### Contributors\n\n \\* [Clifton Cunningham][]  \n \\* [Andreas Richter][]   \n \\* [Dennis Hall][]  \n \\* [Cole Gillespie][]  \n \\* [Jonathan Zacsh][]  \n \\* [Jerad Bitner][]  \n \\* [Martin Moen][]  \n \\* [dale tan][]  \n \\* [Nate Hunzaker][]  \n\n  [http://calip.so/]: http://calip.so/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=calipso&utm_campaign=github\n  [http://travis-ci.org/cliftonc/calipso]: http://travis-ci.org/cliftonc/calipso\n  [Clifton Cunningham]: https://github.com/cliftonc\n  [Dennis Hall]: https://github.com/dennishall\n  [Cole Gillespie]: https://github.com/coleGillespie\n  [Jonathan Zacsh]: https://github.com/jzacsh\n  [Jerad Bitner]: https://github.com/sirkitree\n  [Martin Moen]: https://github.com/botto\n  [dale tan]: https://github.com/dtan\n  [Nate Hunzaker]: https://github.com/nhunzaker\n  [Andreas Richter]: https://github.com/richtera\n\n#MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
